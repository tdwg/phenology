These sunflowers are the same ones that grow wild here on the plains and in the foothills, but at our house I have been watering them regularly all this season.  Now, close to the end of July, we have received 3.99"" of precipitation for the month, fortunately; however, the overall average temperature is 2.4º F. above normal.  Precipitation amounts at our house for May and June were a little less than normal.
The wild sunflowers didn't really start growing in Colorado Springs until after the May 19 snowfall, unless they were near a stream or a road.  Basically, all of the grassy areas in parks and grazing areas didn't turn green until after May 19.  The trees did leaf out to a point, but then suffered many broken branches after the May snowfall.",219440,FL-FIRST,Flowers,"First Flower"
