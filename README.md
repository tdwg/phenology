# Plant Phenology Task Group

The repository of the Plant Phenology task group.

## Motivation

Phenological data are increasingly being used to examine the effects of climate change and other drivers of biological change. Phenological observation networks, historical phenological surveys, and biodiversity specimens have arisen as important sources of phenological data. However, fields for phenological data are not expressly identified in the Darwin Core, and phenological data have variously been stored in the DwC fields occurrenceRemarks, reproductiveCondition, verbatimAttributes, and others, making phenological data difficult to access, aggregate, and analyze at scale across data sources. The California Phenology Network has hitherto used the Measurement Or Fact extension to serve phenological data and thereby capture important metadata about phenological scorings. Still, these data have seen relatively little use by researchers because they are difficult to discover both via GBIF and their data portal. Phenological data are, in practice, lost within such extensions since they arenâ€™t well-explored by the data-using community.

The Plant Phenology Task Group aims to develop a plant phenology extension for the Darwin Core. We will create fields into which plant phenological data can be entered and recommend a standardized vocabulary for use in these fields, drawing heavily from the Plant Phenology Ontology. This task group is focused first on phenological data associated with flowering plants, but the standards will be developed such that phenological data associated with gymnosperms and nonvascular plant groups can be addressed in the future.

The agenda and notes from our first meeting can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W8P73fgJCjKfO5gDGBkdcd0oLDeSsm7a4YZfct0iIIE/edit).

An initial rough draft of our proposed standard (i.e., mapping of Plant Phenology Ontology to the Darwin Core Extended Measurement or Fact Extension) [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I4R9xtWZofhcKi_azo8StivrdxYKeXJxpDHuCM0-wXU/edit?usp=sharing) and is open to comment.
